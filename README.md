# Deep Reinforcement Learning: DQN & Policy Gradient

This repository contains implementations of **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** and **Policy Gradient (PG)** algorithms. The goal of this project is to apply these reinforcement learning techniques on various **OpenAI Gym environments** and analyse their performance, learning behaviour, and hyperparameter sensitivities.

All tasks and requirements for Assignment 3, as specified in the assignment document (`Assignment-3.pdf`), have been fully accomplished.

This repo includes the completed code, generated plots, and analysis for:

* **Problem 1: Deep Q Learning**
    * Implementation of the DQN algorithm.
    * Solutions and analysis for the `MountainCar-v0` and `ALE/Pong-v5` environments.
    * One of the Hyper-parameter tuning analysis

* **Problem 3: Policy Gradient**
    * Implementation of the Policy Gradient algorithm, including reward-to-go and advantage normalisation.
    * Solutions and analysis for the `Cartpole-v1` and `Lunarlander-v3` environments.
    * Batch size impact analysis.
