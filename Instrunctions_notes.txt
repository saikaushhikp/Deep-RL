All the required implementations have been implemented as per the problem statements in each environment's unique folder.

The reports contain observations and inferences based on multiple runs of code that have been implemented, also with the result plots.

Just in case the plot images don't get rendered, the images have captions(explaining what the image was) and a section( parts a,b,c) indicating to redirect to the corresponding folder. 
and find the plots(images) and it's runnable(executable Python) code file.
